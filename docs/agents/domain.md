# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

This repo uses a **multi-context** layout (a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root points to one `CONTEXT.md` per context — fitting for this pnpm monorepo of `apps/` and `packages/`).

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each context's `CONTEXT.md` relevant to the topic you're about to work on.
- **`docs/adr/`** at the root — system-wide architectural decisions.
- **`<context>/docs/adr/`** — context-scoped decisions for the specific app or package you're working in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Multi-context repo (presence of `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root):

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md                      ← points to each context's CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/                           ← system-wide decisions
├── apps/
│   ├── web/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                   ← context-specific decisions
│   └── docs/
│       └── CONTEXT.md
└── packages/
    ├── screenplay-state/
    │   ├── CONTEXT.md
    │   └── docs/adr/
    └── ui/
        └── CONTEXT.md
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in the relevant `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
