 * `path`, and (only if the surface needs opening) a `prepare` that clicks it into
 * view; everything else — light and dark, the viewport, settling, the output
 * filename — is the runner's job (`./lib/capture.ts`). Keeping the list
 * declarative is what makes a before/after pair comparable: both halves shoot the
 * same names in the same order at the same size, so the two directories diff
 * file-for-file.
 *
 * Paths are built from {@link FIXTURE_IDS} rather than written out, so a Canvas
 * renamed in the Fixture World can't leave a screen pointing at a 404.
